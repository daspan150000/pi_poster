# inspiration
This small project is inspired by Dan Shiffman of The Coding Train. this is my try to make a pi day poster using python instead of using P5js.


# running the code
Running "pi_wallpaper.py" will create an image the size of the 1920x1080 
with the first 20737 digits of pi going from top left to bottom right. "3," not included. it will save the image as a PDF file. 

# TODO
[] Make the size of the canvas whatever size i want it

[] Find a better way to calculate pi to the nÂ´th digit 

[] Find a better way to convert from eps to pdf or find a better way to save the image from the TK window.
